# ADR-002: Android-First Development Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose our initial platform strategy for ParentCare. Our target users are adult children (ages 45-65) managing care for elderly parents. We have limited resources as a solo developer and need to validate product-market fit quickly.

Market research shows:
- 70% of our target demographic uses Android
- Android users in this age group tend to keep devices longer (2-4 years)
- Many users have mid-range Android devices ($200-400 price point)
- Cross-platform development adds complexity and learning curve

## Decision
We will build Android-native first using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, targeting Android 7.0+ (API 24). iOS development will begin only after achieving product-market fit on Android (estimated 3-6 months post-launch).

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster MVP delivery** - Single platform reduces complexity by 50%
- **Better performance** - Native performance crucial for older devices
- **Lower learning curve** - Master one platform deeply vs. two superficially
- **Cost-effective testing** - Android devices cheaper for testing
- **Larger initial market** - 70% of target users accessible immediately
- **Simpler debugging** - No cross-platform abstraction layer issues
- **Platform-specific features** - Can leverage Android-specific capabilities

### Negative
- **Missing 30% of market** - iOS users excluded initially
- **No code reuse** - Will need separate iOS codebase later
- **Split resources later** - Eventually maintaining two codebases
- **Delayed iOS revenue** - Missing potential higher-paying iOS users
- **Team scaling challenges** - Need iOS expertise later
- **Brand perception** - May appear less professional without iOS

### Risks
- **iOS users feeling excluded** - Clear communication about iOS timeline
- **Competitive disadvantage** - Competitors may have both platforms
- **Technical debt** - Rushing iOS version later may compromise quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Flutter
- ❌ **Rejected**: Learning curve for Dart and Flutter patterns
- ❌ Larger app size (baseline ~7MB larger)
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem for some use cases
- ✅ Single codebase for both platforms
- ✅ Good performance and native feel

### React Native
- ❌ **Rejected**: JavaScript bridge performance overhead
- ❌ Complex debugging across platforms
- ❌ Frequent breaking changes in ecosystem
- ✅ Large community and ecosystem
- ✅ Web development skills transferable

### Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Still evolving, less stable
- ❌ Limited UI sharing capabilities
- ❌ Smaller community and resources
- ✅ Share business logic, native UI
- ✅ Kotlin consistency across platforms

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Limited offline capabilities
- ❌ No reliable push notifications on iOS
- ❌ App store presence important for trust
- ✅ Single codebase for all platforms
- ✅ No app store approval process

## Success Metrics
- Launch Android MVP within 8 weeks
- Achieve 1000+ active users before iOS development
- Maintain >4.5 star rating on Play Store
- <1% crash rate on Android before expanding
