# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a solo developer building a mobile-first medication coordination platform, we need a backend solution that provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization across family members
- Offline capability with sync
- Push notifications for medication reminders
- Minimal infrastructure management
- Quick time-to-market for MVP
- Cost-effective scaling from 0 to 1000+ users

## Decision
We will use Firebase as our complete backend platform, specifically:
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time database
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications
- **Cloud Functions** for server-side business logic
- **Firebase Storage** for images and documents
- **Firebase Analytics** for user behavior tracking
- **Crashlytics** for crash reporting

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure management** - Focus on app development, not DevOps
- **Real-time sync built-in** - No custom WebSocket implementation needed
- **Generous free tier** - 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day covers early growth
- **Offline support included** - Critical for unreliable connectivity
- **Fast development** - Pre-built SDKs and authentication UI
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles growth without configuration
- **Integrated ecosystem** - Analytics, crash reporting, A/B testing included
- **Time-to-market** - Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster than custom backend

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in** - Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
- **Limited query capabilities** - No SQL joins, complex queries expensive
- **Cost unpredictability** - Usage-based pricing can spike
- **Less control** - Can't optimize database performance directly
- **Firebase-specific knowledge** - Team needs to learn Firebase patterns
- **Regional limitations** - Some regions have limited Firebase presence

### Risks
- **Cost explosion** at scale - Implement usage monitoring and quotas
- **Service outages** - Implement graceful degradation for critical features
- **API limitations** discovered late - Prototype complex features early
- **Data export complexity** - Plan data portability strategy upfront

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- ❌ **Rejected**: 4-6 weeks additional development time
- ❌ Requires managing servers, databases, scaling
- ❌ Need to implement real-time sync, offline support
- ✅ Full control and no vendor lock-in

### AWS Amplify
- ❌ **Rejected**: Steeper learning curve for solo developer
- ❌ More complex pricing model
- ❌ Less integrated than Firebase
- ✅ More powerful and flexible at scale

### Supabase (Open Source Firebase Alternative)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Less mature, smaller community
- ❌ Fewer integrated services (no FCM equivalent)
- ❌ Self-hosting complexity
- ✅ Open source, PostgreSQL-based, no lock-in

### Parse Platform
- ❌ **Rejected**: Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Requires hosting decision
- ❌ Less active development
- ✅ Open source, proven technology

## Migration Strategy
To mitigate vendor lock-in risk:
1. **Repository Pattern** - Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
2. **Domain Models** - Keep business logic Firebase-agnostic
3. **Data Export** - Regular automated backups to cloud storage
4. **Documentation** - Document all Firebase-specific patterns
