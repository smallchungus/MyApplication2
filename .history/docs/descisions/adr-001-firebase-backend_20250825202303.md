ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform
Status
Accepted
Context
As a solo developer building a mobile-first medication coordination platform, we need a backend solution that provides:

User authentication and authorization
Real-time data synchronization across family members
Offline capability with sync
Push notifications for medication reminders
Minimal infrastructure management
Quick time-to-market for MVP
Cost-effective scaling from 0 to 1000+ users

Decision
We will use Firebase as our complete backend platform, specifically:

Firebase Authentication for user management
Cloud Firestore for real-time database
Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications
Cloud Functions for server-side business logic
Firebase Storage for images and documents
Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
Crashlytics for crash reporting

Consequences
Positive

Zero infrastructure management - Focus on app development, not DevOps
Real-time sync built-in - No custom WebSocket implementation needed
Generous free tier - 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day covers early growth
Offline support included - Critical for unreliable connectivity
Fast development - Pre-built SDKs and authentication UI
Automatic scaling - Handles growth without configuration
Integrated ecosystem - Analytics, crash reporting, A/B testing included
Time-to-market - Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster than custom backend

Negative

Vendor lock-in - Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
Limited query capabilities - No SQL joins, complex queries expensive
Cost unpredictability - Usage-based pricing can spike
Less control - Can't optimize database performance directly
Firebase-specific knowledge - Team needs to learn Firebase patterns
Regional limitations - Some regions have limited Firebase presence

Risks

Cost explosion at scale - Implement usage monitoring and quotas
Service outages - Implement graceful degradation for critical features
API limitations discovered late - Prototype complex features early
Data export complexity - Plan data portability strategy upfront

Alternatives Considered
Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)

❌ Rejected: 4-6 weeks additional development time
❌ Requires managing servers, databases, scaling
❌ Need to implement real-time sync, offline support
✅ Full control and no vendor lock-in

AWS Amplify

❌ Rejected: Steeper learning curve for solo developer
❌ More complex pricing model
❌ Less integrated than Firebase
✅ More powerful and flexible at scale

Supabase (Open Source Firebase Alternative)

❌ Rejected: Less mature, smaller community
❌ Fewer integrated services (no FCM equivalent)
❌ Self-hosting complexity
✅ Open source, PostgreSQL-based, no lock-in

Parse Platform

❌ Rejected: Smaller ecosystem
❌ Requires hosting decision
❌ Less active development
✅ Open source, proven technology

Migration Strategy
To mitigate vendor lock-in risk:

Repository Pattern - Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
Domain Models - Keep business logic Firebase-agnostic
Data Export - Regular automated backups to cloud storage
Documentation - Document all Firebase-specific patterns
