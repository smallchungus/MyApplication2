# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a solo developer building a mobile-first medication coordination platform, we need a backend solution that provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization across family members
- Offline capability with sync
- Push notifications for medication reminders
- Minimal infrastructure management
- Quick time-to-market for MVP
- Cost-effective scaling from 0 to 1000+ users

## Decision
We will use Firebase as our complete backend platform, specifically:
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time database
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications
- **Cloud Functions** for server-side business logic
- **Firebase Storage** for images and documents
- **Firebase Analytics** for user behavior tracking
- **Crashlytics** for crash reporting

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure management** - Focus on app development, not DevOps
- **Real-time sync built-in** - No custom WebSocket implementation needed
- **Generous free tier** - 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day covers early growth
- **Offline support included** - Critical for unreliable connectivity
- **Fast development** - Pre-built SDKs and authentication UI
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles growth without configuration
- **Integrated ecosystem** - Analytics, crash reporting, A/B testing included
- **Time-to-market** - Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster than custom backend

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in** - Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
- **Limited query capabilities** - No SQL joins, complex queries expensive
- **Cost unpredictability** - Usage-based pricing can spike
- **Less control** - Can't optimize database performance directly
- **Firebase-specific knowledge** - Team needs to learn Firebase patterns
- **Regional limitations** - Some regions have limited Firebase presence

### Risks
- **Cost explosion** at scale - Implement usage monitoring and quotas
- **Service outages** - Implement graceful degradation for critical features
- **API limitations** discovered late - Prototype complex features early
- **Data export complexity** - Plan data portability strategy upfront

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- ❌ **Rejected**: 4-6 weeks additional development time
- ❌ Requires managing servers, databases, scaling
- ❌ Need to implement real-time sync, offline support
- ✅ Full control and no vendor lock-in

### AWS Amplify
- ❌ **Rejected**: Steeper learning curve for solo developer
- ❌ More complex pricing model
- ❌ Less integrated than Firebase
- ✅ More powerful and flexible at scale

### Supabase (Open Source Firebase Alternative)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Less mature, smaller community
- ❌ Fewer integrated services (no FCM equivalent)
- ❌ Self-hosting complexity
- ✅ Open source, PostgreSQL-based, no lock-in

### Parse Platform
- ❌ **Rejected**: Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Requires hosting decision
- ❌ Less active development
- ✅ Open source, proven technology

## Migration Strategy
To mitigate vendor lock-in risk:
1. **Repository Pattern** - Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
2. **Domain Models** - Keep business logic Firebase-agnostic
3. **Data Export** - Regular automated backups to cloud storage
4. **Documentation** - Document all Firebase-specific patterns

# ADR-002: Android-First Development Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose our initial platform strategy for ParentCare. Our target users are adult children (ages 45-65) managing care for elderly parents. We have limited resources as a solo developer and need to validate product-market fit quickly.

Market research shows:
- 70% of our target demographic uses Android
- Android users in this age group tend to keep devices longer (2-4 years)
- Many users have mid-range Android devices ($200-400 price point)
- Cross-platform development adds complexity and learning curve

## Decision
We will build Android-native first using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, targeting Android 7.0+ (API 24). iOS development will begin only after achieving product-market fit on Android (estimated 3-6 months post-launch).

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster MVP delivery** - Single platform reduces complexity by 50%
- **Better performance** - Native performance crucial for older devices
- **Lower learning curve** - Master one platform deeply vs. two superficially
- **Cost-effective testing** - Android devices cheaper for testing
- **Larger initial market** - 70% of target users accessible immediately
- **Simpler debugging** - No cross-platform abstraction layer issues
- **Platform-specific features** - Can leverage Android-specific capabilities

### Negative
- **Missing 30% of market** - iOS users excluded initially
- **No code reuse** - Will need separate iOS codebase later
- **Split resources later** - Eventually maintaining two codebases
- **Delayed iOS revenue** - Missing potential higher-paying iOS users
- **Team scaling challenges** - Need iOS expertise later
- **Brand perception** - May appear less professional without iOS

### Risks
- **iOS users feeling excluded** - Clear communication about iOS timeline
- **Competitive disadvantage** - Competitors may have both platforms
- **Technical debt** - Rushing iOS version later may compromise quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Flutter
- ❌ **Rejected**: Learning curve for Dart and Flutter patterns
- ❌ Larger app size (baseline ~7MB larger)
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem for some use cases
- ✅ Single codebase for both platforms
- ✅ Good performance and native feel

### React Native
- ❌ **Rejected**: JavaScript bridge performance overhead
- ❌ Complex debugging across platforms
- ❌ Frequent breaking changes in ecosystem
- ✅ Large community and ecosystem
- ✅ Web development skills transferable

### Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Still evolving, less stable
- ❌ Limited UI sharing capabilities
- ❌ Smaller community and resources
- ✅ Share business logic, native UI
- ✅ Kotlin consistency across platforms

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Limited offline capabilities
- ❌ No reliable push notifications on iOS
- ❌ App store presence important for trust
- ✅ Single codebase for all platforms
- ✅ No app store approval process

## Success Metrics
- Launch Android MVP within 8 weeks
- Achieve 1000+ active users before iOS development
- Maintain >4.5 star rating on Play Store
- <1% crash rate on Android before expanding

# ADR-003: Commitment-Based Onboarding

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional medication reminder apps suffer from catastrophic retention rates (<10% after 90 days) despite high initial signup rates (60-80%). They optimize for frictionless onboarding, resulting in users who haven't invested emotionally or temporally in the solution.

Research shows:
- Users who invest 30+ minutes in setup are 8x more likely to remain active
- Family involvement increases retention by 3.5x
- Sunk cost fallacy can be leveraged for positive behavior change
- Quality of users matters more than quantity for network effects

## Decision
We will implement an intentionally intensive 30-45 minute onboarding process that:
1. Requires significant time investment (minimum 30 minutes)
2. Involves multiple family members during setup
3. Includes educational content about medication adherence
4. Captures detailed parent health information
5. Ends with a "commitment contract" psychological tool
6. Allows multi-session completion but tracks progress

We expect only 15-25% completion rate but >70% long-term retention.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Higher quality users** - Self-selection for motivated individuals
- **Better retention** - 7-10x industry average expected
- **Psychological commitment** - Sunk cost creates stickiness
- **Family buy-in** - Social accountability from start
- **Complete data** - Thorough profiles enable better features
- **Lower support costs** - Committed users need less hand-holding
- **Word-of-mouth growth** - Highly engaged users more likely to refer

### Negative
- **Lower vanity metrics** - Fewer total users initially
- **Slower growth** - Can't claim "1M downloads"
- **A/B testing challenges** - Smaller sample sizes
- **Investor skepticism** - Unconventional metrics
- **Marketing difficulty** - Can't promise "quick and easy"
- **Risk of frustration** - Some good users may abandon

### Risks
- **Onboarding too intensive** - Monitor completion rate, adjust if <10%
- **Wrong friction points** - Ensure friction creates value, not frustration
- **Competitor copying** - First-mover advantage critical
- **User expectations** - Clear value communication essential

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Easy Onboarding
- ❌ **Rejected**: Proven to fail in this market
- ❌ Creates no commitment or investment
- ✅ Higher initial numbers
- ✅ Industry standard approach

### Freemium Model
- ❌ **Rejected**: Free users unlikely to convert
- ❌ Doesn't solve commitment problem
- ✅ Larger user base for network effects
- ✅ Potential for upselling

### Paid App Model
- ❌ **Rejected**: Price alone doesn't ensure commitment
- ❌ Barrier to family member participation
- ✅ Revenue from day one
- ✅ Self-selecting for serious users

### Progressive Onboarding
- ❌ **Rejected**: Allows users to avoid commitment
- ❌ Partial setup leads to poor experience
- ✅ Less intimidating initially
- ✅ Higher completion rates

## Implementation Details

### Onboarding Stages
1. **Introduction Video** (3 min) - Why medication adherence matters
2. **Commitment Assessment** (5 min) - Quiz to gauge readiness
3. **Parent Profile** (10 min) - Detailed health information
4. **Medication Inventory** (10 min) - Current medications with photos
5. **Family Coordination** (7 min) - Invite and assign roles
6. **Emergency Preparation** (5 min) - Critical information setup
7. **Commitment Contract** (5 min) - Psychological commitment tool

### Commitment Scoring Algorithm
```
Score = (Time Invested × 0.25) + 
        (Profile Completeness × 0.30) +
        (Family Members × 0.20) +
        (Detail Quality × 0.15) +
        (Contract Strength × 0.10)
```

### Success Metrics
- Onboarding completion: 15-25%
- Average time invested: 35-45 minutes
- Multi-session users: <30%
- 30-day retention post-onboarding: >80%
- Family members invited average: 2.5
