# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a solo developer building a mobile-first medication coordination platform, we need a backend solution that provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization across family members
- Offline capability with sync
- Push notifications for medication reminders
- Minimal infrastructure management
- Quick time-to-market for MVP
- Cost-effective scaling from 0 to 1000+ users

## Decision
We will use Firebase as our complete backend platform, specifically:
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time database
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications
- **Cloud Functions** for server-side business logic
- **Firebase Storage** for images and documents
- **Firebase Analytics** for user behavior tracking
- **Crashlytics** for crash reporting

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure management** - Focus on app development, not DevOps
- **Real-time sync built-in** - No custom WebSocket implementation needed
- **Generous free tier** - 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day covers early growth
- **Offline support included** - Critical for unreliable connectivity
- **Fast development** - Pre-built SDKs and authentication UI
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles growth without configuration
- **Integrated ecosystem** - Analytics, crash reporting, A/B testing included
- **Time-to-market** - Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster than custom backend

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in** - Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
- **Limited query capabilities** - No SQL joins, complex queries expensive
- **Cost unpredictability** - Usage-based pricing can spike
- **Less control** - Can't optimize database performance directly
- **Firebase-specific knowledge** - Team needs to learn Firebase patterns
- **Regional limitations** - Some regions have limited Firebase presence

### Risks
- **Cost explosion** at scale - Implement usage monitoring and quotas
- **Service outages** - Implement graceful degradation for critical features
- **API limitations** discovered late - Prototype complex features early
- **Data export complexity** - Plan data portability strategy upfront

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- ❌ **Rejected**: 4-6 weeks additional development time
- ❌ Requires managing servers, databases, scaling
- ❌ Need to implement real-time sync, offline support
- ✅ Full control and no vendor lock-in

### AWS Amplify
- ❌ **Rejected**: Steeper learning curve for solo developer
- ❌ More complex pricing model
- ❌ Less integrated than Firebase
- ✅ More powerful and flexible at scale

### Supabase (Open Source Firebase Alternative)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Less mature, smaller community
- ❌ Fewer integrated services (no FCM equivalent)
- ❌ Self-hosting complexity
- ✅ Open source, PostgreSQL-based, no lock-in

### Parse Platform
- ❌ **Rejected**: Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Requires hosting decision
- ❌ Less active development
- ✅ Open source, proven technology

## Migration Strategy
To mitigate vendor lock-in risk:
1. **Repository Pattern** - Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
2. **Domain Models** - Keep business logic Firebase-agnostic
3. **Data Export** - Regular automated backups to cloud storage
4. **Documentation** - Document all Firebase-specific patterns

# ADR-002: Android-First Development Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose our initial platform strategy for ParentCare. Our target users are adult children (ages 45-65) managing care for elderly parents. We have limited resources as a solo developer and need to validate product-market fit quickly.

Market research shows:
- 70% of our target demographic uses Android
- Android users in this age group tend to keep devices longer (2-4 years)
- Many users have mid-range Android devices ($200-400 price point)
- Cross-platform development adds complexity and learning curve

## Decision
We will build Android-native first using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, targeting Android 7.0+ (API 24). iOS development will begin only after achieving product-market fit on Android (estimated 3-6 months post-launch).

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster MVP delivery** - Single platform reduces complexity by 50%
- **Better performance** - Native performance crucial for older devices
- **Lower learning curve** - Master one platform deeply vs. two superficially
- **Cost-effective testing** - Android devices cheaper for testing
- **Larger initial market** - 70% of target users accessible immediately
- **Simpler debugging** - No cross-platform abstraction layer issues
- **Platform-specific features** - Can leverage Android-specific capabilities

### Negative
- **Missing 30% of market** - iOS users excluded initially
- **No code reuse** - Will need separate iOS codebase later
- **Split resources later** - Eventually maintaining two codebases
- **Delayed iOS revenue** - Missing potential higher-paying iOS users
- **Team scaling challenges** - Need iOS expertise later
- **Brand perception** - May appear less professional without iOS

### Risks
- **iOS users feeling excluded** - Clear communication about iOS timeline
- **Competitive disadvantage** - Competitors may have both platforms
- **Technical debt** - Rushing iOS version later may compromise quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Flutter
- ❌ **Rejected**: Learning curve for Dart and Flutter patterns
- ❌ Larger app size (baseline ~7MB larger)
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem for some use cases
- ✅ Single codebase for both platforms
- ✅ Good performance and native feel

### React Native
- ❌ **Rejected**: JavaScript bridge performance overhead
- ❌ Complex debugging across platforms
- ❌ Frequent breaking changes in ecosystem
- ✅ Large community and ecosystem
- ✅ Web development skills transferable

### Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Still evolving, less stable
- ❌ Limited UI sharing capabilities
- ❌ Smaller community and resources
- ✅ Share business logic, native UI
- ✅ Kotlin consistency across platforms

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Limited offline capabilities
- ❌ No reliable push notifications on iOS
- ❌ App store presence important for trust
- ✅ Single codebase for all platforms
- ✅ No app store approval process

## Success Metrics
- Launch Android MVP within 8 weeks

# ADR-003: Commitment-Based Onboarding

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional medication reminder apps suffer from catastrophic retention rates (<10% after 90 days) despite high initial signup rates (60-80%). They optimize for frictionless onboarding, resulting in users who haven't invested emotionally or temporally in the solution.

Research shows:
- Users who invest 30+ minutes in setup are 8x more likely to remain active
- Family involvement increases retention by 3.5x
- Sunk cost fallacy can be leveraged for positive behavior change
- Quality of users matters more than quantity for network effects

## Decision
We will implement an intentionally intensive 30-45 minute onboarding process that:
1. Requires significant time investment (minimum 30 minutes)
2. Involves multiple family members during setup
3. Includes educational content about medication adherence
4. Captures detailed parent health information
5. Ends with a "commitment contract" psychological tool
6. Allows multi-session completion but tracks progress

We expect only 15-25% completion rate but >70% long-term retention.

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Higher quality users** - Self-selection for motivated individuals
- **Better retention** - 7-10x industry average expected
- **Psychological commitment** - Sunk cost creates stickiness
- **Family buy-in** - Social accountability from start
- **Complete data** - Thorough profiles enable better features
- **Lower support costs** - Committed users need less hand-holding
- **Word-of-mouth growth** - Highly engaged users more likely to refer

### Negative
- **Lower vanity metrics** - Fewer total users initially
- **Slower growth** - Can't claim "1M downloads"
- **A/B testing challenges** - Smaller sample sizes
- **Investor skepticism** - Unconventional metrics
- **Marketing difficulty** - Can't promise "quick and easy"
- **Risk of frustration** - Some good users may abandon

### Risks
- **Onboarding too intensive** - Monitor completion rate, adjust if <10%
- **Wrong friction points** - Ensure friction creates value, not frustration
- **Competitor copying** - First-mover advantage critical
- **User expectations** - Clear value communication essential

## Alternatives Considered

### Traditional Easy Onboarding
- ❌ **Rejected**: Proven to fail in this market
- ❌ Creates no commitment or investment
- ✅ Higher initial numbers
- ✅ Industry standard approach

### Freemium Model
- ❌ **Rejected**: Free users unlikely to convert
- ❌ Doesn't solve commitment problem
- ✅ Larger user base for network effects
- ✅ Potential for upselling

### Paid App Model
- ❌ **Rejected**: Price alone doesn't ensure commitment
- ❌ Barrier to family member participation
- ✅ Revenue from day one
- ✅ Self-selecting for serious users

### Progressive Onboarding
- ❌ **Rejected**: Allows users to avoid commitment
- ❌ Partial setup leads to poor experience
- ✅ Less intimidating initially
- ✅ Higher completion rates

## Implementation Details

### Onboarding Stages
1. **Introduction Video** (3 min) - Why medication adherence matters
2. **Commitment Assessment** (5 min) - Quiz to gauge readiness
3. **Parent Profile** (10 min) - Detailed health information
4. **Medication Inventory** (10 min) - Current medications with photos
5. **Family Coordination** (7 min) - Invite and assign roles
6. **Emergency Preparation** (5 min) - Critical information setup
7. **Commitment Contract** (5 min) - Psychological commitment tool

### Commitment Scoring Algorithm
```
Score = (Time Invested × 0.25) + 
        (Profile Completeness × 0.30) +
        (Family Members × 0.20) +
        (Detail Quality × 0.15) +
        (Contract Strength × 0.10)
```

### Success Metrics
- Onboarding completion: 15-25%
- Average time invested: 35-45 minutes
- Multi-session users: <30%
- 30-day retention post-onboarding: >80%
- Family members invited average: 2.5

# ADR-004: Offline-First Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our users need reliable access to medication information regardless of connectivity. Many scenarios require offline access:
- Rural areas with poor connectivity
- Hospital buildings with limited cell service
- Emergency situations where internet may be unavailable
- International travel without data plans
- Battery-saving mode with data disabled
- Network outages or service disruptions

Additionally, offline-first architecture provides performance benefits and reduces Firebase costs through caching.

## Decision
We will implement a true offline-first architecture where:
1. **Room database is the single source of truth** for the UI
2. **Firebase Firestore acts as a synchronization layer**, not primary storage
3. **All features work offline** with sync when connected
4. **Conflict resolution uses last-write-wins** with audit logging
5. **Background sync via WorkManager** when connection restored
6. **7-day offline capability** before requiring sync

## Consequences

### Positive
- **100% feature availability offline** - Critical for emergencies
- **Instant UI response** - No network latency for reads
- **Reduced Firebase costs** - Fewer reads through caching
- **Better perceived performance** - Immediate feedback
- **Resilient to outages** - Service disruptions don't affect users
- **Battery efficiency** - Less network usage
- **Predictable behavior** - Same UX online and offline

### Negative
- **Increased complexity** - Sync logic and conflict resolution
- **Larger app size** - Local database and sync queue
- **Data freshness challenges** - Potential for stale data
- **Testing complexity** - Many edge cases for sync
- **Debugging difficulty** - Sync issues hard to reproduce
- **Storage management** - Need to handle device storage limits

### Risks
- **Sync conflicts** - Multiple family members editing offline
- **Data loss** - Failed syncs could lose changes
- **Storage exhaustion** - Too much cached data
- **Stale data** - Medication changes not reflected

## Alternatives Considered

### Online-First with Cache
- ❌ **Rejected**: Features unavailable offline
- ❌ Poor user experience with connectivity issues
- ✅ Simpler implementation
- ✅ Always fresh data

### Selective Offline
- ❌ **Rejected**: Confusing UX with partial functionality
- ❌ Difficult to explain limitations to users
- ✅ Reduced complexity
- ✅ Smaller storage footprint

### Manual Sync
- ❌ **Rejected**: Users forget to sync
- ❌ Risk of data loss
- ✅ User control over data usage
- ✅ Predictable sync timing

## Implementation Strategy

### Data Flow Architecture
```
UI Layer
    ↓ (observes)
ViewModels
    ↓ (reads from)
Repository Layer
    ↓ (single source of truth)
Room Database
    ↓ (background sync)
Sync Manager ←→ Firebase
```

### Sync Strategy
1. **Immediate sync** for critical operations (emergency contacts)
2. **Batched sync** for routine updates (every 15 minutes)
3. **Opportunistic sync** when app foregrounded
4. **Scheduled sync** via WorkManager (every 6 hours)
5. **Force sync** option for users

### Conflict Resolution
- **Last-write-wins** for simple fields
- **Merge strategy** for collections (medications list)
- **Audit log** for all changes with timestamps
- **Manual resolution UI** for critical conflicts

### Storage Management
- **Maximum cache**: 100MB for images
- **Data retention**: 30 days for historical data
- **Cleanup strategy**: LRU eviction for images
- **User control**: Clear cache option in settings

## Success Metrics
- Offline session success rate: >95%
- Sync failure rate: <1%
- Average sync delay: <30 seconds
- Storage usage: <200MB average
- Conflict rate: <0.1% of syncs

# ADR-005: MVVM with Clean Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a robust, testable, and maintainable architecture pattern for our Android application. The architecture should:
- Separate concerns clearly
- Enable unit testing of business logic
- Support our offline-first requirement
- Scale as features are added
- Be familiar to Android developers for future team growth
- Follow Android best practices and Google recommendations

## Decision
We will implement MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern with Clean Architecture principles:

1. **Presentation Layer** (UI)
   - Jetpack Compose screens
   - ViewModels for state management
   - No business logic

2. **Domain Layer** (Business Logic)
   - Use Cases for complex operations
   - Domain models (pure Kotlin)
   - Business rules and validation

3. **Data Layer** (Data Management)
   - Repository pattern for data abstraction
   - Local data sources (Room)
   - Remote data sources (Firebase)
   - Data mapping between layers

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Testability** - Each layer independently testable
- **Separation of Concerns** - Clear responsibilities
- **Maintainability** - Changes isolated to specific layers
- **Google Recommended** - First-class Android support
- **Offline-First Ready** - Repository pattern enables data source switching
- **Team Scalability** - Clear structure for collaboration
- **Code Reusability** - Use cases shareable across features

### Negative
- **Initial complexity** - More boilerplate for simple features
- **Learning curve** - Team needs to understand all layers
- **More files** - Each feature split across multiple classes
- **Over-engineering risk** - Simple CRUD might not need use cases
- **Performance overhead** - Additional abstraction layers

### Risks
- **Over-abstraction** - Creating unnecessary layers
- **Inconsistent implementation** - Different patterns per developer
- **Anemic domain models** - Logic leaking into wrong layers

## Alternatives Considered

### MVI (Model-View-Intent)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Steeper learning curve
- ❌ More complex for simple features
- ✅ Unidirectional data flow
- ✅ Better for complex state management

### MVP (Model-View-Presenter)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Dated pattern for Android
- ❌ Poor Compose integration
- ❌ Harder to test
- ✅ Simpler than MVVM
- ✅ Clear contract interfaces

### Plain MVVM (No Clean Architecture)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Business logic in ViewModels
- ❌ Harder to test business rules
- ❌ Less scalable
- ✅ Simpler implementation
- ✅ Fewer files

### Redux/MVI with Compose
- ❌ **Rejected**: Overcomplicated for our needs
- ❌ Team unfamiliarity
- ✅ Predictable state management
- ✅ Time-travel debugging

## Implementation Guidelines

### Layer Communication Rules
```
UI → ViewModel → UseCase → Repository → DataSource
         ↑            ↑           ↑
    StateFlow    Domain Model  Entity
```

### When to Create Use Cases
- **Create** when: Multiple repositories involved, complex business logic, reusable operations
- **Skip** when: Simple CRUD, direct repository calls, no business logic

### Testing Strategy
- **ViewModels**: Test state transformations
- **Use Cases**: Test business logic
- **Repositories**: Test data coordination
- **Data Sources**: Test with fakes/mocks

## Success Metrics
- Unit test coverage: >80%
- Average feature development time: <3 days
- Code review approval rate: >90% first pass
- Bug rate: <1 per feature

# ADR-006: Jetpack Compose for UI

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose between Jetpack Compose (modern declarative UI) and XML layouts (traditional view system) for our user interface implementation. This decision impacts:
- Development speed
- UI testing approach
- Performance characteristics
- Learning curve
- Long-term maintainability
- Access to latest Material Design components

## Decision
We will use Jetpack Compose for all new UI development. Existing XML layouts will be maintained but migrated opportunistically. The migration strategy is:
1. All new screens in Compose
2. Migrate existing screens when they need significant changes
3. Keep XML for complex existing screens that work well
4. Use ComposeView for gradual migration within XML layouts

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster development** - Less boilerplate, hot reload
- **Better state management** - Declarative UI with recomposition
- **Modern toolkit** - Latest Material 3 components
- **Improved testing** - Easier UI testing with Compose Test
- **Type safety** - Compile-time checking for UI
- **Animation simplicity** - Declarative animations
- **Google's future** - Long-term support guaranteed
- **Preview functionality** - See UI without running app

### Negative
- **Learning curve** - New mental model for UI
- **Debugging challenges** - Recomposition issues can be tricky
- **Performance concerns** - Need to optimize recomposition
- **Limited resources** - Fewer examples and libraries
- **XML interop complexity** - Mixed layouts add complexity
- **APK size increase** - Compose adds ~2MB to APK

### Risks
- **Performance issues** - Incorrect composition leading to jank
- **Memory leaks** - Incorrect remember/lifecycle usage
- **Incomplete migration** - Mixed UI technologies long-term

## Alternatives Considered

### XML Layouts Only
- ❌ **Rejected**: Legacy technology, Google moving away
- ❌ More boilerplate code
- ❌ Harder state management
- ✅ Team familiarity
- ✅ Mature ecosystem

### Compose-Only (Full Migration)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Too risky to migrate everything at once
- ❌ Time consuming for MVP
- ✅ Consistent codebase
- ✅ No interop complexity

### Custom View System
- ❌ **Rejected**: Massive undertaking
- ❌ No community support
- ✅ Full control
- ✅ Optimized for our needs

## Implementation Strategy

### Compose Configuration
```kotlin
buildFeatures {
    compose = true
}
composeOptions {
    kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.4"
}
```

### State Management Pattern
- Use `ViewModel` with `StateFlow`
- Compose observes state with `collectAsState()`
- Unidirectional data flow
- Immutable state objects

### Performance Guidelines
- Use `remember` for expensive operations
- Implement `key` parameter for lists
- Avoid inline lambdas that capture state
- Use `derivedStateOf` for computed values
- Profile with Layout Inspector

### Testing Approach
- Use Compose Testing library
- Test semantics, not implementation
- Screenshot testing for critical screens
- Accessibility testing built-in

## Migration Priority
1. **Onboarding flow** - New feature, perfect for Compose
2. **Family dashboard** - Complex state management benefits
3. **Settings screens** - Simple, good practice
4. **Authentication** - Keep XML for now (working well)

## Success Metrics
- UI development time: 40% reduction
- UI test coverage: >70%
- Recomposition performance: <16ms per frame
- Developer satisfaction: Positive feedback
