# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As a solo developer building a mobile-first medication coordination platform, we need a backend solution that provides:
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time data synchronization across family members
- Offline capability with sync
- Push notifications for medication reminders
- Minimal infrastructure management
- Quick time-to-market for MVP
- Cost-effective scaling from 0 to 1000+ users

## Decision
We will use Firebase as our complete backend platform, specifically:
- **Firebase Authentication** for user management
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time database
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications
- **Cloud Functions** for server-side business logic
- **Firebase Storage** for images and documents
- **Firebase Analytics** for user behavior tracking
- **Crashlytics** for crash reporting

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Zero infrastructure management** - Focus on app development, not DevOps
- **Real-time sync built-in** - No custom WebSocket implementation needed
- **Generous free tier** - 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day covers early growth
- **Offline support included** - Critical for unreliable connectivity
- **Fast development** - Pre-built SDKs and authentication UI
- **Automatic scaling** - Handles growth without configuration
- **Integrated ecosystem** - Analytics, crash reporting, A/B testing included
- **Time-to-market** - Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster than custom backend

### Negative
- **Vendor lock-in** - Difficult to migrate away from Firebase
- **Limited query capabilities** - No SQL joins, complex queries expensive
- **Cost unpredictability** - Usage-based pricing can spike
- **Less control** - Can't optimize database performance directly
- **Firebase-specific knowledge** - Team needs to learn Firebase patterns
- **Regional limitations** - Some regions have limited Firebase presence

### Risks
- **Cost explosion** at scale - Implement usage monitoring and quotas
- **Service outages** - Implement graceful degradation for critical features
- **API limitations** discovered late - Prototype complex features early
- **Data export complexity** - Plan data portability strategy upfront

## Alternatives Considered

### Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)
- ❌ **Rejected**: 4-6 weeks additional development time
- ❌ Requires managing servers, databases, scaling
- ❌ Need to implement real-time sync, offline support
- ✅ Full control and no vendor lock-in

### AWS Amplify
- ❌ **Rejected**: Steeper learning curve for solo developer
- ❌ More complex pricing model
- ❌ Less integrated than Firebase
- ✅ More powerful and flexible at scale

### Supabase (Open Source Firebase Alternative)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Less mature, smaller community
- ❌ Fewer integrated services (no FCM equivalent)
- ❌ Self-hosting complexity
- ✅ Open source, PostgreSQL-based, no lock-in

### Parse Platform
- ❌ **Rejected**: Smaller ecosystem
- ❌ Requires hosting decision
- ❌ Less active development
- ✅ Open source, proven technology

## Migration Strategy
To mitigate vendor lock-in risk:
1. **Repository Pattern** - Abstract Firebase behind interfaces
2. **Domain Models** - Keep business logic Firebase-agnostic
3. **Data Export** - Regular automated backups to cloud storage
4. **Documentation** - Document all Firebase-specific patterns

# ADR-002: Android-First Development Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to choose our initial platform strategy for ParentCare. Our target users are adult children (ages 45-65) managing care for elderly parents. We have limited resources as a solo developer and need to validate product-market fit quickly.

Market research shows:
- 70% of our target demographic uses Android
- Android users in this age group tend to keep devices longer (2-4 years)
- Many users have mid-range Android devices ($200-400 price point)
- Cross-platform development adds complexity and learning curve

## Decision
We will build Android-native first using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, targeting Android 7.0+ (API 24). iOS development will begin only after achieving product-market fit on Android (estimated 3-6 months post-launch).

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster MVP delivery** - Single platform reduces complexity by 50%
- **Better performance** - Native performance crucial for older devices
- **Lower learning curve** - Master one platform deeply vs. two superficially
- **Cost-effective testing** - Android devices cheaper for testing
- **Larger initial market** - 70% of target users accessible immediately
- **Simpler debugging** - No cross-platform abstraction layer issues
- **Platform-specific features** - Can leverage Android-specific capabilities

### Negative
- **Missing 30% of market** - iOS users excluded initially
- **No code reuse** - Will need separate iOS codebase later
- **Split resources later** - Eventually maintaining two codebases
- **Delayed iOS revenue** - Missing potential higher-paying iOS users
- **Team scaling challenges** - Need iOS expertise later
- **Brand perception** - May appear less professional without iOS

### Risks
- **iOS users feeling excluded** - Clear communication about iOS timeline
- **Competitive disadvantage** - Competitors may have both platforms
- **Technical debt** - Rushing iOS version later may compromise quality

## Alternatives Considered

### Flutter
- ❌ **Rejected**: Learning curve for Dart and Flutter patterns
- ❌ Larger app size (baseline ~7MB larger)
- ❌ Less mature ecosystem for some use cases
- ✅ Single codebase for both platforms
- ✅ Good performance and native feel

### React Native
- ❌ **Rejected**: JavaScript bridge performance overhead
- ❌ Complex debugging across platforms
- ❌ Frequent breaking changes in ecosystem
- ✅ Large community and ecosystem
- ✅ Web development skills transferable

### Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Still evolving, less stable
- ❌ Limited UI sharing capabilities
- ❌ Smaller community and resources
- ✅ Share business logic, native UI
- ✅ Kotlin consistency across platforms

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
- ❌ **Rejected**: Limited offline capabilities
- ❌ No reliable push notifications on iOS
- ❌ App store presence important for trust
- ✅ Single codebase for all platforms
- ✅ No app store approval process

## Success Metrics
- Launch Android MVP within 8 weeks
- Achieve 1000+ active users before iOS development
- Maintain >4.5 star rating on Play Store
- <1% crash rate on Android before expanding
