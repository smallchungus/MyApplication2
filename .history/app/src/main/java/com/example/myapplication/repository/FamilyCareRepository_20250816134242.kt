/**
 * Repository for family care coordination data management.
 * 
 * Implements the Repository pattern to provide a clean abstraction over data sources
 * and business logic for family medication coordination. This repository manages
 * assignment tracking, medication adherence monitoring, and family member coordination.
 * 
 * Architecture Design:
 * - Single source of truth for family care data
 * - Reactive data streams using Kotlin Flow
 * - Clean separation between data layer and UI
 * - Proper error handling and logging for medical app reliability
 * - Thread-safe operations for concurrent family member access
 * 
 * Business Logic:
 * - Assignment status management and validation
 * - Critical medication alerts and notifications
 * - Family member responsibility tracking
 * - Real-time coordination updates
 * 
 * Future Extensions:
 * - Firebase Firestore integration for cloud sync
 * - Offline support with local database caching
 * - Push notifications for urgent situations
 * - Integration with pharmacy systems
 * 
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @see FamilyData for core data models
 * @see Assignment for medication assignment structure
