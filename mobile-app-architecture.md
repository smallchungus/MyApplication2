# ParentCare Mobile App - Technical Design Document

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: December 2024  
**Author**: Solo Developer  
**Status**: Draft

---

## üìã Executive Summary

ParentCare is a family medication coordination app that deliberately implements high-friction onboarding to filter for committed users. This contrarian approach trades high user acquisition for exceptional retention, targeting adult children (45-65) managing elderly parent care rather than seniors directly.

### Key Metrics
- **Target onboarding completion**: 15-25% (intentionally low)
- **Post-onboarding 90-day retention**: >70% (industry avg: 5%)
- **Development timeline**: 8 weeks to MVP
- **Initial platform**: Android only (70% of target demographic)

---

## üéØ Problem Statement

### Market Reality
Traditional medication reminder apps fail because they optimize for the wrong metrics:
- **High signup rates (60-80%)** but catastrophic retention **(5-10% at 90 days)**
- **Feature bloat** creates complexity without solving core problems
- **Wrong target user** - seniors struggle with technology adoption
- **No accountability mechanism** when motivation naturally fluctuates

### Our Hypothesis
**Commitment-based filtering through intensive onboarding will create a smaller but highly engaged user base that actually succeeds at medication adherence.**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Platform Choice: Android Native

**Decision**: Build native Android with Kotlin first

**Rationale**:
- 70% of 45-65 age group uses Android (our primary users)
- Native performance critical for older devices
- Kotlin provides null safety and coroutines out of the box
- Single platform allows faster iteration as solo developer

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Flutter**: Better for cross-platform, but adds complexity and learning curve
- **React Native**: JavaScript ecosystem familiar, but performance overhead unacceptable
- **Progressive Web App**: Considered for family dashboard, but push notifications unreliable

**Future Consideration**: iOS version after proving product-market fit

---

### Backend Architecture: Firebase

**Decision**: All-in Firebase ecosystem

**Rationale**:
- Managed infrastructure crucial for solo developer
- Real-time sync included without custom WebSocket implementation
- Generous free tier (50K reads/day covers first 1000 users)
- Automatic scaling without DevOps overhead
- Integrated analytics and crash reporting

**Trade-offs Accepted**:
- Vendor lock-in risk
- Limited query capabilities compared to SQL
- Potential cost spike at scale
- Less control over performance optimization

**Migration Strategy**: Abstract Firebase behind repository pattern for future flexibility

---

### UI Framework: Jetpack Compose

**Decision**: New screens in Compose, maintain existing XML

**Rationale**:
- Declarative UI reduces state management bugs
- Faster development once learning curve overcome
- Better testing story than XML
- Google's clear future direction

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Keep XML for complex existing screens initially
- Gradual migration as features stabilized
- Team can maintain both during transition

---

### Architecture Pattern: MVVM + Clean Architecture

**Decision**: MVVM with repository pattern and use cases

**Rationale**:
- Clear separation of concerns essential for maintainability
- Repository pattern allows backend swapping if needed
- Use cases document business logic explicitly
- MVVM is Android standard, easier to onboard help if needed

**Implementation Priorities**:
1. Repository pattern first (flexibility)
2. ViewModels for state management
3. Use cases for complex business logic only
4. Don't over-engineer simple CRUD operations

---

## üí° Core Feature Decisions

### Commitment-Based Onboarding

**Decision**: 30-45 minute intensive onboarding process

**Design Principles**:
- **Time investment creates commitment** (sunk cost fallacy as feature)
- **Multi-session allowed** but progress tracked
- **Family involvement required** for social accountability
- **Educational content** interwoven to provide value
- **Commitment contract** at end for psychological buy-in

**Success Metrics**:
- Completion rate: 15-25% (low is good)
- Time invested: 30+ minutes average
- Family members invited: 2+ average
- Contract completion: 100% of completers

---

### Offline-First Architecture

**Decision**: Full offline capability with sync queue

**Rationale**:
- Seniors often have unreliable internet
- Medical data must be accessible in emergencies
- Reduces Firebase costs through caching
- Better perceived performance

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Room database as single source of truth
- Firebase as sync layer, not primary storage
- Conflict resolution: last-write-wins with audit log
- Background sync via WorkManager

---

### Family Coordination Model

**Decision**: Assignment-based responsibility system

**Core Concepts**:
- **Daily assignments** instead of fixed ownership
- **Automatic redistribution** when someone unavailable
- **Check-in confirmations** for accountability
- **Escalation paths** for missed medications

**Why This Works**:
- Prevents single point of failure
- Distributes emotional burden
- Creates peer accountability
- Flexible for real family dynamics

---

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Protection Strategy

**Decisions Made**:
- **Encryption**: TLS in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with email/password initially
- **Authorization**: Family-based access control
- **PHI Handling**: HIPAA-compliant practices even if not required

**Future Considerations**:
- Biometric authentication for app access
- End-to-end encryption for family chat
- HIPAA BAA with Firebase if scaling to healthcare providers
- Regular security audits at 10K+ users

---

## üìä Data Architecture

### Schema Design Principles

**Approach**: Denormalized for read performance

**Rationale**:
- Firestore charges per read, optimize for fewer reads
- Duplicate data acceptable for query simplification
- Real-time listeners need efficient queries
- Write costs lower than read costs

**Key Collections**:
- `users`: Authentication and profile data
- `families`: Family groups and metadata
- `parents`: Health profiles (subcollection under families)
- `medications`: Medication schedules (subcollection under parents)
- `assignments`: Daily responsibility tracking
- `audit_log`: All medication-related actions

---

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Test-First Development

**Decision**: AI-assisted test generation before implementation

**Process**:
1. Define feature requirements
2. Generate comprehensive test suite with AI
3. Review and refine generated tests
4. Implement until tests pass
5. Add edge cases discovered during implementation

**Coverage Targets**:
- **Unit tests**: 85% (business logic)
- **Integration tests**: 70% (data layer)
- **UI tests**: Critical paths only (manual for rest)

**Why This Works**:
- AI generates edge cases humans miss
- Tests document expected behavior
- Refactoring safer with comprehensive tests
- Catches regressions early

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Management

### Technical Risks

**High Priority**:
- **Onboarding abandonment**: Mitigate with progress saving, multi-session support
- **Firebase cost explosion**: Rate limiting, usage monitoring, alerts
- **Family permission complexity**: Start simple (admin/member), iterate

**Medium Priority**:
- **Offline sync conflicts**: Last-write-wins initially, manual resolution later
- **Android fragmentation**: Min SDK 24, test on common devices
- **Performance on old devices**: Aggressive lazy loading, image optimization

**Accepted Risks**:
- Single platform initially (Android only)
- Firebase vendor lock-in
- Limited offline duration (7 days)
