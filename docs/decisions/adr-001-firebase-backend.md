# ADR-001: Use Firebase as Backend Platform

## Status
Accepted

## Problem (2-3 sentences)
Solo developer needs backend solution for medication coordination platform with real-time sync, offline support, and zero infrastructure management. Traditional custom backend would require 4-6 weeks additional development time and ongoing DevOps overhead.

## Decision
- **Choice**: Firebase as complete backend platform
- **Why**: Zero infrastructure management enables focus on app development
- **Trade-off**: Accept vendor lock-in for faster time-to-market

### Firebase Services
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Cloud Firestore for real-time database  
- FCM for push notifications
- Cloud Functions for server-side logic

## Alternatives
| Option | Pro | Con | Why Rejected |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Custom Backend | Full control, no lock-in | 4-6 weeks dev time, DevOps overhead | Resource constraints |
| AWS Amplify | More powerful at scale | Steeper learning curve | Solo dev complexity |
| Supabase | PostgreSQL-based, open source | Less mature ecosystem | Smaller community |
| Parse Platform | Proven technology | Requires hosting decision | Less active development |

## Success Metrics
- **Development Speed**: Ship MVP 3-4 weeks faster
- **Cost Efficiency**: Stay within free tier for first 6 months
- **Performance**: <2s app startup with Firebase integration
- **Reliability**: 99.9% Firebase service availability

## Test Strategy
- **Integration Testing**: Firebase emulator for local testing
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor Firestore read/write quotas
- **Backup Strategy**: Weekly exports to Cloud Storage
- **Migration Plan**: Repository pattern to abstract Firebase dependencies
