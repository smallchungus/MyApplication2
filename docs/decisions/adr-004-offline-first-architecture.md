# ADR-004: Offline-First Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Problem (2-3 sentences)
Users need reliable medication information access during emergencies, in rural areas with poor connectivity, and in hospital buildings with limited cell service. Network-dependent apps fail when users most need critical medication data for elderly care coordination.

## Decision
- **Choice**: True offline-first architecture with Room as single source of truth
- **Why**: 100% feature availability regardless of connectivity for critical healthcare use
- **Trade-off**: Accept increased complexity for reliable offline operation

### Implementation
- Room database as primary data source
- Firebase Firestore for background synchronization
- WorkManager for automatic sync when connected
- 7-day offline capability before requiring sync

## Alternatives
| Option | Pro | Con | Why Rejected |
|--------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Online-First Cache | Simpler implementation, always fresh data | Features unavailable offline | Poor UX during connectivity issues |
| Selective Offline | Reduced complexity, smaller storage | Confusing UX with partial functionality | Difficult to explain limitations |
| Manual Sync | User control, predictable timing | Users forget to sync, risk of data loss | Reliability concerns |

## Success Metrics
- **Offline Sessions**: >95% success rate without connectivity
- **Sync Reliability**: <1% sync failure rate
- **Performance**: <30 seconds average sync delay
- **Storage**: <200MB average app storage usage

## Test Strategy
- **Offline Testing**: Simulate various connectivity scenarios
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test multi-user editing scenarios
- **Performance**: Monitor sync performance under load
- **Storage Management**: Test cleanup and retention strategies
