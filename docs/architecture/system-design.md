# System Design - Lean MVP Architecture

## Problem (2-3 sentences)
Solo developer building family medication coordination MVP needs simple, scalable architecture that can ship in 8 weeks. Over-engineered enterprise solutions would prevent market validation and product-market fit discovery.

## Solution
**Lean startup architecture** using Firebase + Android native development with offline-first design for reliable healthcare coordination.

## MVP Architecture

### High-Level Design
```
Android App (Kotlin + Compose)
        ↓
Firebase Services (Backend-as-a-Service)
        ↓
Room Database (Local Storage + Sync)
```

### Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 | Native Android UI |
| **State** | ViewModel + StateFlow | Reactive state management |
| **Backend** | Firebase (Auth + Firestore + FCM) | Zero-infrastructure backend |
| **Local DB** | Room + SQLCipher | Offline-first data storage |
| **DI** | Hilt | Dependency injection |
| **Testing** | JUnit + Mockito + Compose Test | Comprehensive testing |

## Architecture Decisions

### Firebase Over Custom Backend
| Aspect | Firebase | Custom Backend |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Development Time** | 2 weeks | 8-12 weeks |
| **Infrastructure** | Zero management | DevOps overhead |
| **Scaling** | Automatic | Manual configuration |
| **Cost** | $0-50/month initially | $200+/month minimum |
| **Why Chosen** | Enables MVP focus | Too complex for solo dev |

### Android-First Strategy
- **Target Market**: 70% Android users in 45-65 demographic
- **Resource Constraint**: Solo developer capacity
- **Time to Market**: 8 weeks vs 16+ weeks for cross-platform
- **Quality**: Native performance for healthcare reliability

### Offline-First Design
- **Healthcare Requirement**: Must work without internet
- **User Context**: Hospital/rural areas with poor connectivity
- **Data Sync**: Background sync when connected
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with audit trail

## Data Architecture

### Local-First with Cloud Sync
```
UI Layer (Compose)
     ↓
ViewModel (StateFlow)
     ↓
Repository (Interface)
     ↓
Room Database (Single Source of Truth)
     ↓
Sync Manager ←→ Firebase Firestore
```

### Database Design
| Entity | Purpose | Key Fields |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `User` | Authentication and profile | uid, email, familyIds |
| `Family` | Family group management | id, name, members[], adminId |
| `Parent` | Care recipient information | id, name, medicalInfo, familyId |
| `Medication` | Medication details and schedule | id, name, schedule{}, parentId |
| `Assignment` | Daily care tasks | id, date, assignedTo, tasks[] |

## Security Design

### Data Protection Strategy
| Data Type | Protection Level | Implementation |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Authentication** | Multi-factor | Firebase Auth + biometrics |
| **Local Storage** | Encrypted | SQLCipher database encryption |
| **Network** | TLS 1.3 | Firebase default security |
| **Access Control** | Role-based | Family admin/member/viewer roles |

### Firebase Security Rules
```javascript
// Simple, secure Firestore rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /families/{familyId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid in resource.data.memberIds;
    }
  }
}
```

## Scalability Plan

### Current Capacity (MVP)
- **Users**: 1,000 families
- **Data**: 10GB Firestore storage
- **API**: 50K reads/20K writes per day
- **Cost**: <$50/month Firebase usage

### Growth Strategy (Post-MVP)
- **10K families**: Firebase scales automatically
- **100K families**: Add Firebase regions, optimize queries
- **1M families**: Consider microservices migration if needed

## Performance Targets

### MVP Benchmarks
| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **App Start** | <2s | Cold start to dashboard |
| **Screen Navigation** | <300ms | Between screens |
| **Data Sync** | <5s | Full family data refresh |
| **Offline Operation** | 100% | All features work offline |

### Monitoring Strategy
- **Firebase Analytics**: User behavior and retention
- **Crashlytics**: Crash reporting and performance
- **Custom Events**: Medication adherence tracking
- **Performance**: Firebase Performance SDK

## Development Approach

### Lean Startup Methodology
- **Build**: MVP with core medication tracking
- **Measure**: User engagement and adherence rates
- **Learn**: Iterate based on user feedback
- **Pivot**: Adjust features based on data

### Feature Prioritization
```
Week 1-2: Core medication management
Week 3-4: Family coordination basics
Week 5-6: Push notifications and sync
Week 7-8: Polish and launch preparation
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Firebase Vendor Lock-in** | High | Repository pattern abstracts Firebase |
| **Offline Sync Conflicts** | Medium | Last-write-wins + user notification |
| **Performance on Old Devices** | Medium | Target Android 7.0+, optimize for low-end |
| **Data Loss** | High | Automated backups + user data export |

### Business Risks
- **Market Validation**: User interviews before feature development
- **Competition**: Focus on family coordination differentiator
- **Monetization**: Validate willingness to pay early

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- **Reliability**: <1% crash rate
- **Performance**: 95% of operations <2s
- **Test Coverage**: >85% overall
- **Build Success**: >95% CI/CD pipeline

### Business KPIs  
- **User Retention**: 60% at day 7
- **Feature Adoption**: 80% use core features
- **Family Engagement**: 2+ active members per family
- **NPS Score**: >50 (good for early product)

## Future Considerations

### Post-MVP Scaling (6-12 months)
- **iOS App**: React Native or native iOS
- **Web Dashboard**: Admin interface for families
- **API Integration**: Pharmacy and doctor systems
- **Advanced Analytics**: Adherence insights and recommendations

### Enterprise Pivot (12+ months)
- **B2B2C Model**: Partner with healthcare providers
- **Clinical Integration**: EHR and pharmacy APIs
- **Compliance**: HIPAA Business Associate Agreements
- **White-label**: Custom solutions for health systems
