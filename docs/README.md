## Problem (2-3 sentences)
Families struggle to coordinate medication management for elderly parents across multiple caregivers, leading to missed doses and health risks. Current solutions require technical expertise or lack real-time family coordination features.

## MVP Solution
Android-native medication coordination app enabling families to:
- Track medications with simple scheduling
- Coordinate care tasks between family members
- Work reliably offline for healthcare emergencies
- Send notifications for medication reminders

## MVP Goals
- **Development**: 8-week MVP delivery
- **Target Users**: 100 families for initial validation
- **Performance**: <2s app startup, 100% offline functionality
- **Success**: 60% day-7 retention, 2+ active family members

## Lean Startup Architecture

### MVP Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Jetpack Compose + Material 3 (native Android)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth + Firestore + FCM) - zero infrastructure
- **Local Storage**: Room + SQLCipher (offline-first)
- **State Management**: ViewModel + StateFlow (reactive)
- **DI**: Hilt (dependency injection)

### MVP Decision Rationale
| Decision | Alternative | Why Chosen for MVP |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Firebase Backend | Custom API | 8 weeks faster development |
| Android Native | Cross-platform | 70% of target users, better performance |
| Offline-First | Online-only | Healthcare requires reliability |
| Family Focus | Individual users | Unique market differentiator |

### Data Flow
```
User Action → ViewModel → Use Case → Repository → Room Database
     ←         StateFlow    ←         ←            ←
                                              ↕
                                    Background Sync ←→ Firebase
```

## Development Approach

### Lean Startup Methodology

### Security Implementation
```javascript
// Simple Firestore security rules
allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
  && request.auth.uid in resource.data.memberIds;
```
